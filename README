This is an incomplete, buggy, proof-of-concept prototype (got it?) of a
thin wrapper of libpython for QML. Ideally, this should allow you to import
Python modules in QML and execute Python expressions from within your QML
JavaScript code.

Thanks to Attila Csipa and Ville Vainio for the initial idea of this approach
during MeeGo Conference Spring 2011 in San Francisco.

This is obviously not intended as a replacement for the awesome PySide, but
could be a viable alternative in some corner cases where PySide is not
available (e.g. Symbian^3, for which no PySide build exists yet).
