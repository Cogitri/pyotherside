Data type conversion:

 - Python tuple to Qt list

Would be nice:

 - Obtaining references to Python objects from QML (if only by key)
 - Upcalls from Python to QML (or signals / events / ...)

Other stuff:

 - Load libpython at runtime, don't link against it
 - Statically link libpython, no need for shared library
 - Embed python scripts into qt resources, load from there
 - PyOtherSide services could be provided by some "dummy" module, e.g.:

     import pyotherside

     data = pyotherside.read_from_qtresource(':/data.txt')
     blubb = pyotherside.import_module(':/blubb.py')
